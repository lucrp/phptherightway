# Iterators & Iterable Type - Iterate Over Objects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFPP9B-Q3zM

In PHP we can iterate over arrays:
```php
foreach (['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] as $key => $value) {
    echo $key . ' = ' . $value . PHP_EOL;
}
```
```
0 = a
1 = b
2 = c
3 = d
4 = e
```
And we can also iterate over objects in PHP using foreach loops. By default it will
iterate over **all the visible or accessible properties** of the object. 

For example, in `Invoice` class we have 2 public properties (`$id` and `$amount`):

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Exception;

class Invoice
{
    public string $id;

    public function __construct(public float $amount)
    {
        $this->id = random_int(10000, 9999999);
    }
}
```
In `index.php` we iterate over `Invoice` instantiating the class and passing an amount:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

foreach (new \App\Invoice(25) as $key => $value) {
    echo $key . ' = ' . $value . PHP_EOL;
}
```
And if we run the code we get the names and values of the public properties:
```
id = 4464835
amount = 25
```
But if we change the visibility of these properties to `protected` or `private` it no longer works.

This is not the most useful way of iterating over objects though (and it is not that performant).

What if we could iterate over objects in a specific way, maybe iterate over some array property that is within this object,
or have a way to define how we want this object to be iterated over ?

And that is possible in PHP and we saw an example in [DateTime Object video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkTQkaFzEEo). 
Using `DatePeriod` class we were able to iterate over DatePeriod object and we were getting back each individual date.

If we take a look at [PHP's doc about DatePeriod class](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.dateperiod.php) we can see that
this class implements `IteratorAggregate`, a built-in PHP interface that extends `Traversable`, an internal engine
interface used to detect if a class is traversable using foreach.

So we can use `Iterator` or `IteratorAggregate` to define how objects of classes should be iterated.

For example, let's imagine we have a class called `InvoiceCollection` which represents a list of invoice objects with 
some methods that work on those objects:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class InvoiceCollection
{

    public function __construct(public array $invoices)
    {
    }
}
```
First, let's try to `foreach` over a list of invoices:

```php
$invoiceCollection = new InvoiceCollection([new \App\Invoice(15) ,new \App\Invoice(25), new \App\Invoice(50)]);

foreach ($invoiceCollection as $invoice) {
    echo $invoice->id . ' - ' . $invoice->amount . PHP_EOL;
}
```

We get warnings that we're trying to access the properties `id` and `amount` on an array:

`Warning: Attempt to read property "id" on array in /var/www/public/index.php on line 14`

`Warning: Attempt to read property "amount" on array in /var/www/public/index.php on line 14`

And that makes sense, because when we iterate over objects like this, it's trying to iterate over all the visible properties
and InvoiceCollection only has a single property which is called `$invoices`. 

If we `var_dump($invoice)` inside the foreach
loop we can see it's just an array of invoices. So that's not what we're trying to do. 

Instead, we want to iterate over the `Invoice`'s properties that is within the `InvoiceCollection`. Basically, we want 
to run that loop over the `$invoices` property.

We can do that by either implementing `Iterator` interface or `IteratorAggregate` interface.

## `Iterator` interface

Let's start with `Iterator`. 

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use JetBrains\PhpStorm\Internal\TentativeType;

class InvoiceCollection implements \Iterator
{

    public function __construct(public array $invoices)
    {
    }

    public function current()
    {
        // TODO: Implement current() method.
    }

    public function next()
    {
        // TODO: Implement next() method.
    }

    public function key()
    {
        // TODO: Implement key() method.
    }

    public function valid()
    {
        // TODO: Implement valid() method.
    }

    public function rewind()
    {
        // TODO: Implement rewind() method.
    }
}
```

We need to implement it with all the methods that are provided by this interface. Ant it has 
5 methods that we need to provide the implementation for: `current()`,`next()`,`key()`,`valid()` and `rewind()`:

- `current()` is supposed to return the current element, or the current invoice in our example, from the `InvoiceCollection`:
```php
    public function current()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;
        
        return current($this->invoices);
    }
```
- `next()` should bring the internal pointer to the next element. And we can use PHP's function `next()` to do that:
```php
    public function next()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        next($this->invoices);
    }
```
- `key()` returns the key of the current element of an array:
```php
    public function key()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return key($this->invoices);
    }
```
- `valid()` checks if the current position is valid. If this method returns false then the foreach loop will stop. 
There are a few ways to check this but here we will simply use the `current()` function to get the current element of the
array and if it returns false, then it's no longer valid.
```php
    public function valid()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return current($this->invoices) !== false;
    } 
```
- `rewind()` is called in the beginning of the foreach loop. It needs to reset the array pointer back to the beginning.
In order to do so, we can use PHP's `reset()` function. This method does not return anything:
```php
    public function rewind()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        reset($this->invoices);
    } 
```

We're echoing the methods name using the magic method `__METHOD__`:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class InvoiceCollection implements \Iterator
{

    public function __construct(public array $invoices)
    {
    }

    public function current()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return current($this->invoices);
    }

    public function next()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        next($this->invoices);
    }

    public function key()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return key($this->invoices);
    }

    public function valid()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return current($this->invoices) !== false;
    }

    public function rewind()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        reset($this->invoices);
    }
}
```

If we run this code again with `php public/index.php`:
```php
// index.php
$invoiceCollection = new InvoiceCollection([new \App\Invoice(15) ,new \App\Invoice(25), new \App\Invoice(50)]);

foreach ($invoiceCollection as $invoice) {
    echo $invoice->id . ' - ' . $invoice->amount . PHP_EOL;
}
```
We get:
```bash
root@800eb8598abe:/var/www# php public/index.php
App\InvoiceCollection::rewind # rewind() is called first
App\InvoiceCollection::valid # then it calls the valid() method, that returns true
App\InvoiceCollection::current # finally it calls current() that returns the current object (the first Invoice object)
5172343 - 15 # echoes out the current Invoice id and amount properties 
App\InvoiceCollection::next # then calls the next() method to advance the pointer to the next element of the array
App\InvoiceCollection::valid # calls the valid() method to check if it's valid
App\InvoiceCollection::current # and calls the current() again to get the current object and so on
9687211 - 25
App\InvoiceCollection::next
App\InvoiceCollection::valid
App\InvoiceCollection::current
641042 - 50
App\InvoiceCollection::next # in the last element, when next() is called, it returns false
App\InvoiceCollection::valid # then valid() also returns false and quit the foreach loop.
```

So here we've implemented a custom iterator, a custom invoice collection where we're able to iterate our invoice collection
using the `foreach` loop and access those `Invoice` objects. It's true that we need to implement some other methods to make 
this useful, like `isEmpty()`, `count()`, `sorting()` etc. 

Also note that we could use an index or a position property instead of using PHP's built-in functions:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class InvoiceCollection implements \Iterator
{
    private int $key;

    public function __construct(public array $invoices)
    {
    }

    public function current()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return $this->invoices[$this->key];
    }

    public function next()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        ++$this->key;
    }

    public function key()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return $this->key;
    }

    public function valid()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        return isset($this->invoices[$this->key]);
    }

    public function rewind()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . PHP_EOL;

        $this->key = 0;
    }
}
```

## `IteratorAggregate` interface

If you're iterating over simple arrays like this, build a custom Iterator might be overkill. 
[PHP has a lot of built-in iterators](https://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.iterators.php) that you could use instead.

And we will use the `ArrayIterator` to replace all the code above. And to use it, we have to implement the `IteratorAggregate` interface.
This interface has a single method called `getIterator()` that returns a iterator or an instance of a `Traversable` interface.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Exception;
use Traversable;

class InvoiceCollection implements \IteratorAggregate
{
    public function __construct(public array $invoices)
    {
    }

    public function getIterator(): Traversable
    {
        return new \ArrayIterator($this->invoices);
    }
}
```
And if we run the code in index.php, everything still works:
```bash
4000980 - 15
1043936 - 25
9248939 - 50
```

So if you're working with simple arrays, and need the ability to iterate over your objects that contain the array property,
`IteratorAggregate` is better because you only need to implement a single method. But for more fine-grained control and complex arrays
`Iterator` interface is the way to go.

But what if we had another collection, like a CustomerCollection or a PaymentProfileCollection class ?
We would be duplicating this `getIterator()` method code. To avoid that, we could extract this code into a base `Collection` class:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Collection implements \IteratorAggregate
{

    public function __construct(private array $items) // change $invoices to more generic $items
    {
    }

    public function getIterator()
    {
        return new \ArrayIterator($this->items); // iterate over the $items
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class InvoiceCollection extends Collection
{

}
```

And it's still working:
```bash
root@800eb8598abe:/var/www# php public/index.php
8285668 - 15
4197403 - 25
2806954 - 50
```
## Iterable Type & Type hinting

What if we had a function or a method that expected an argument that could either be an array, a collection or any type 
that could be iterated over. How can we typehint this ?

```php
function foo($iterable)
{
    foreach ($iterable as $item) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
If we typehint as an array and if we pass in a Collection, it's going to fail. 
If we typehint as a Collection and pass it an array, it's also going to fail.

With PHP8 we can solve this by using Union Types to typehint both array or collection, and it will work
```php
function foo(\App\Collection|array $iterable)
{
    foreach ($iterable as $item) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
But if you had more types of iterators that are not Collections nor arrays, you would have to chain these types and it's not the best solution:
```php
function foo(\App\Collection|array|AnotherIterator|AnotherOne $iterable)
{
//...
}
```
PHP 7.1 has a pseudo-type called `Iterable`, which you can use to typehint all iterable types:

```php
foo($invoiceCollection);
foo([]);

function foo($iterable)
{
    foreach ($iterable as $index => $item) {
        echo $index . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
