# Learn PHP The Right Way

Notes for [Program With Gio](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgramWithGio) YouTube channel's course [Learn PHP The Right Way](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3d3QYzkw2xabQRUpcZ_IBk9W50M9pe-) . It's basically a transcription from the videos with the code examples.

As I already know the basics, I started to note from the second part (it's just missing 2.2 PHP Classes & Objects) to remember key concepts and to learn PHP8 new features.

## Docker

This repo already contains ready to use Dockerfile with PHP 8.0.2 and Nginx.

## Notes

As I keep going, I delete some lines in PHP files but almost all the code used in the videos is noted in the Markdown files.

Feel free to contribute and to use these notes to study as you follow this great resource to learn PHP.
