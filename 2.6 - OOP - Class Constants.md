- Class constants are allocated once per class and not per instance which means that we don't need to have the instance of the class to access the class constants.
```php
echo Transaction::STATUS_PAID;
```

But you can also instantiate a class and call the constant:

```php
$transaction = new Transaction();
echo $transaction::class; // return the Fully qualified name 
// App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction
echo $transaction::STATUS_PAID;
```

To better organize your code you can create a class to manage constants for Transaction Statuses :

```php
<?php

namespace App\Enums;

class Status
{
    public const PAID = 'paid';
    public const PENDING = 'pending';
    public const DECLINED = 'declined';

    // Lookup Table containing all statuses with a friendly name to display to the final user
    public const ALL_STATUSES = [
        self::PAID => 'Paid',
        self::PENDING => 'Pending',
        self::DECLINED => 'Declined',
    ];
}
```

In Transaction.php you can create a public function setStatus and throw an error if status does not match with all status set in the lookup table :

```php
    public function setStatus(string $status): self
    {

        if (!isset(Status::ALL_STATUSES[$status])) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Invalid status');
        }

        $this->status = $status;

        return $this;
    }
```

And in `index.php` pass this constant class as an argument to setStatus method from Transaction:
```php
$transaction = new Transaction();
$transaction->setStatus(Status::PAID);
var_dump($transaction);
```
