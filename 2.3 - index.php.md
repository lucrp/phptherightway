// Classes & Objects

// $transaction = new Transaction(100, 'Transaction 1');

// $transaction->addTax(8);
// $transaction->applyDiscount(10);
// We are calling the 2 methods (addTax and applyDiscount) on the same object, so we are using this variable multiple times. Instead of doing this, in order to avoid duplicating the call of those functions, we could actually chain methods by returning the current object from those methods. After that, we can do something like this:
$transaction = (new Transaction(100, 'Transaction 1'))
    ->addTax(8)
    ->applyDiscount(10);

$amount = $transaction->getAmount();

// var_dump($amount); // Amount will be printed before Destruct. This is because we still have the reference of the Object available until the end of the script. Destruct is called only in the end of the script.

// Chaining methods creates this more readable way of building your objects. But chaining methods will not always make sense, like if we had to return a tax with a getTax method.

// We can create multiple transactions as the class is a blueprint:
// $transaction2 = (new Transaction(200, 'Transaction 2'))
//     ->addTax(8)
//     ->applyDiscount(15);

    // var_dump($transaction2->getAmount());

    // null safe operator
echo $transaction->customer?->paymentProfile->id;
