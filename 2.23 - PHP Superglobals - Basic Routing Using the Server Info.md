# PHP Superglobals - Basic Routing Using the Server Info

> Superglobals are built-in variables that are always available  within all scopes throughout your PHP code.

These variables are useful to work with input from the forms and from the users, persist sessions and cookies,
upload files, look into requests etc.

See the PHP docs for more info: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

## '$_SERVER'
This superglobal contains information about the server and execution environment. The content will vary depending on 
your server's configuration.

There are many use cases for `$_SERVER`. One of them is to build basic routing. Now, all routes hit the `index.php`.

Routing allows us to structure the application in a better way and in any way we want. Le's build a very simple routing:

The goal is: when we visit a page like `localhost:8000/invoices`, we want to run index method on the `invoice.php` class.
If we visit `localhost:8000/customers`, we want to run index method on the `customer.php` class.

There are many ways of implementing routing and router in general. You can go full dynamic and have dynamically load pages
or use routes mapping where you predefine and map all the available routes to their corresponding action classes & methods.
There are also packages available that you could install via Composer or you could simply use a framework like Laravel or Symfony.

For this lesson we're going to build a simple routing using mapped routes. So this cannot be used in production, it's just for
learning purposes.

First, we need to create a Router class with a method to register the route:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App;

use App\Exceptions\RouteNotFoundException;

class Router
{
    private array $routes;

    public function register(string $route, callable $action): self
    {
        $this->routes[$route] = $action;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * @throws RouteNotFoundException
     */
    public function resolve(string $requestUri)
    {
        $route = explode('?', $requestUri)[0];
        $action = $this->routes[$route] ?? null;

        if (! $action) {
            throw new RouteNotFoundException();
        }

        return call_user_func($action);
    }
}
```

We add the RouteNotFoundException:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Exceptions;

class RouteNotFoundException extends \Exception
{
    protected $message = '404 Not Found';
}
```

And in `index.php` we call this class with the methods created:
```php
use App\Router;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$router = new Router();

$router->register(
    '/',
    function () {
        echo 'Home';
    }
);

$router->register(
    '/invoices',
    function () {
        echo 'Invoices';
    }
);

echo $router->resolve($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
```

And now, if we go to `localhost:8000/invoices` we get the Invoices printed and if we to home route, we get the Home printed.
And if we go to a page that not exists, we get the 404 message error.

In real applications you wouldn't put all your logic into callback functions like this, it's recommended to use controllers.

But for now we can pass in an array with a class name and a method name, so when we hit the home page, we may want to run 
an index method within the home.php class, and the home.php class can be within the  `[App\Classes\Home::class]`

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App;

use App\Exceptions\RouteNotFoundException;

class Router
{
    private array $routes;

    public function register(string $route, callable|array $action): self // we can typehint $action being callable OR an array
    {
        $this->routes[$route] = $action;

        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * @throws RouteNotFoundException
     */
    public function resolve(string $requestUri)
    {
        $route = explode('?', $requestUri)[0];
        $action = $this->routes[$route] ?? null;

        // Throw exception if route does not exist
        if (! $action) {
            throw new RouteNotFoundException();
        }

        if (is_callable($action)) { // check if $action is callable and call call_ser_func() if true
            return call_user_func($action);
        }

        if (is_array($action)) {
            list($class, $method) = $action; // Destructure $action array into $class and $method variables

            if (class_exists($class)) { // check if class_exists and create a new class object if true
                $class = new $class();

                // check if the class method exists and, if true, return call_ser_func_array with an array of
                // $class and $method and empty arguments array for now
                if (method_exists($class, $method)) {
                    return call_user_func_array([$class, $method], []);
                    // the reason we're using call_user_func_array here is because we need to specify
                    // x amount of arguments, this is the better way to specify it using array instead
                    // of specifying each individual arguments
                }
            }
        }

        throw new RouteNotFoundException(); // if it's not an array, call Exception
    }
}
```
and in index.php
```php
<?php

use App\Router;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$router = new Router();

$router
    ->register('/', [App\Classes\Home::class, 'index'])
    ->register('/invoices', [App\Classes\Invoice::class, 'index'])
    ->register('/invoices/create', [App\Classes\Invoice::class, 'create'])
;

echo $router->resolve($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
```
