```php
use PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
use PaymentGateway\Stripe\Transaction as StripeTransaction; // alias
use PaymentGateway\Paddle\CustomerProfile;
```
- alias can be used to group classes that are in the same namespace using Namespace\{Class1, Class2} or importing the Namespace and using Namespace\ClassName(); to instantiate the classes.

```php
use PaymentGateway\Paddle\{Transaction, CustomerProfile};
use PaymentGateway\Paddle;
```

- Think of namespaces as virtual directory structures for your classes, to avoid conflits between them.

- You can use the name you want, but it is recommended and also a standard to match namespace with the folder structure.

- Other way of doing so, is by importing the Transaction class from the namespace by using the `use` keyword.

- You can also namespace constants and functions and import them, but is not encouraged and not widely used this way.
