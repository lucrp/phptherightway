# Anonymous classes
PHP has [anonymous functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_FOIxYLF-s) and also 
anonymous classes. Anonymous classes can accept arguments through the constructor.

in `index.php`:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$obj = new class(1, 2, 3) {
    public function __construct(public int $x,public int $y,public int $z,)
    {

    }
};

var_dump($obj);
```

if we execute this code inside the container with `php public/index.php` we get:

```bash
object(class@anonymous)#2 (3) {
  ["x"]=>
  int(1)
  ["y"]=>
  int(2)
  ["z"]=>
  int(3)
}
```

Anonymous classes can also use inheritance and extend another classes. You can also implement interfaces, use traits and so on,
just like a regular class. Just because you do not define a name for an anonymous class, it does not mean it has no name.
The name is generated and assigned by the engine:

```php
$obj = new class(1, 2, 3) {
    public function __construct(public int $x,public int $y,public int $z,)
    {

    }
};

var_dump(get_class($obj));
```
Which results:
```
string(45) "class@anonymous/var/www/public/index.php:5$0"
```
But it is not a good practice to rely on this name, so assume that anonymous classes have no name, and because they have no name, you 
cannot type hint them. However you can implement an interface and typehint the interface instead:

```php
<?php

use App\MyInterface;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$obj = new class(1, 2, 3) implements MyInterface{
    public function __construct(public int $x,public int $y,public int $z,)
    {

    }
};

foo($obj);

function foo(MyInterface $obj)
{
    var_dump($obj);
}
```

You can also use anonymous classes within regular classes, you can sort of nest them.

```php
<?php

namespace App\AnonymousClasses;

class ClassA
{
    public function __construct(public int $x, public int $y)
    {
    }

    public function foo(): string
    {
        return 'foo';
    }

    public function bar(): object
    {
        return new class {

        };
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

use App\AnonymousClasses\ClassA;
use App\MyInterface;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$obj = new ClassA(1, 2);

var_dump($obj->bar());
```
And this will return an instance of an anonymous class:
```bash
root@2bcfc2caa1c4:/var/www# php public/index.php
object(class@anonymous)#4 (0) {
}
```
Note that within the anonymous class, you cannot access the properties and methods of the main class:
```php
    public function bar(): object
    {
        return new class {
            public function __construct()
            {
                $this->x; // This will not work! $this variable here refers to the anonymous class itself ant
                // it's not referring to the outer class.
            }
        };
    }
```
What we can do instead, if we need to access the main class properties and methods, is to extend the main class in the anonymous function:
```php
<?php

namespace App\AnonymousClasses;


class ClassA
{
    public function __construct(public int $x, public int $y)
    {
    }

    public function foo(): string
    {
        return 'foo';
    }

    public function bar(): object
    {
        return new class($this->x, $this->y) extends ClassA {
            public function __construct(public int $x, public int $y)
            {
                parent::__construct($x, $y);
            }
        };
    }
}
```

But if you do not want to use inheritance, you have 2 options:

1. Pass down properties as arguments in the constructor:
```php
    public function bar(): object
    {
        return new class($this->x, $this->y) { // even with inheritance we have to pass the properties as arguments 
            public function __construct(public int $x, public int $y)
            {
                parent::__construct($x, $y);
            }
        };
    }
```

2. Pass down the current object:
```php
    public function bar(): object
    {
        return new class($this) {
            public function __construct(ClassA $myObj)
            {
                var_dump($this->x, $this->y);
            }
        };
    } 
```

## Use cases
Quick points from the [RFC that implements anonymous classes](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/anonymous_classes):
- Mocking tests becomes easy as pie. Create on-the-fly implementations for interfaces, avoiding using complex mocking APIs.
- Keep usage of these classes outside the scope they are defined in
- Avoid hitting the autoloader for trivial implementations
