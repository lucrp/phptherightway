### Interface
Interfaces is like a contract that defines all the necessary actions or methods that an object must have


The way of creating an Interface is the same we use to create a class but using the Interface keyword instead

```php
<?php

namespace App;

interface DebtCollector
{
    public function collet(float $owedAmount): float;
    
}

```

ALL the methods declared within the interface MUST be implemented within the concrete classes.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CollectionAgency implements DebtCollector
{
    public function collect(float $owedAmount): float
    {
        // TODO: Implement collect() method
    }
}
```

Other rules of Interfaces
- All methods declared with an interface MUST be public
- As similar to inheritance, the same signature compatibility rules apply to implemented methods
- You can force concrete classes to have magic methods. You could have a __construct declaration within the interface to force the concrete class that implements it to have also a __construct method.
- You can implement mumitple interfaces:
```php
class CollectionAgency implements DebtCollector, AnotherInterface
{
    public function collect(...)
}
```
- You cannot have properties in interfaces, but you can have constants.
- Constants declared in interfaces cannot be overriden.
