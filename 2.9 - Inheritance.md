Inheritance allows you to have a class that is derived from another class. It's also refered as parent child classes, where the parent is the base class that you derive from. The child class will inherit the public and protected methods, constants and properties, which then can be overriden.

In addition of inheriting these, you could also have additional properties, constants and methods.

For this example, let's say we're implementing a toaster simulator that can toast bread.

```php
<?php
	
namespace App;

class Toaster
{
	public array $slices = [];
	public int $size = 2;
	
	public function addSlice(string $slice): void
	{
		if(count($this->slices) < $this->size) {
			$this->slices[] = $slice;
		}
	}
	
	public function toast()
	{
		foreach ($this->slices as $i => $slice) {
			echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . PHP_EOL;
		}
	}
}
```

index.php
```php
<?php

use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
use App\Toaster;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$toaster = new Toaster();

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->toast();
```
It will only display toasting 2 slices.

What if we want to have another class like ToasterPro that will be able to toast 4 slices instead of 2 and have an option to toast bagel ?

We can make another class `ToasterPro` and inherit the properties and methods from `Toaster`, because the ToasterPro is also a Toaster:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public int $size = 4;

    public function toastBagel()
    {
        foreach ($this->slices as $i => $slice) {
            echo ($i + 1) . ': Toasting ' . $slice . 'with bagel option';
        }
    }
}
```

As mentioned in previous lessons, you're able to overwrite public and protected properties, constants and methods, and that's exactly what we're doing here: we're overriding the `$size` property with the value of 4. Now in `index.php` we can instantiate `ToasterPro` class and toast 4 slices:

```php
$toaster = new ToasterPro();

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->toast();

```
That will return:
```
1: Toasting bread 2: Toasting bread 3: Toasting bread 4: Toasting bread
```

And now we can also toast the slices with the bagel option:

```php
$toasterPro->toastBagel();
```

## The $this variable

Like we've seen in the previous lessons, the `$this` variable refers to the calling object. In this case when we access the properties/methods using the `$this` variable it does not necessarily means that it is accessing those properties on the parent class. It can be accessing them on the child class.

If we `var_dump($this)` in the `Toaster` class (the parent class), we'll see that `$this` refers to the `ToasterPro` class because that is the calling object. 

If we go to the index, we're instantiating the `ToasterPro` and we're calling the method `addSlice` from the `Toaster` class, which is the parent. `ToasterPro` inherits or extends `Toaster` class, which is why `$this` variable in the parent (`Toaster` class) is referring to the `ToasterPro` instance.

**Another important points:** 
- you cannot override `private` properties. **A private property belong and exist only in the class.** You can only access and overwrite public and protected properties, methods and constants.

- **You cannot decrease the visibility of the property.** If you set the property to public in the parent class, you cannot set the same property as private in the child class. The same error appears if you set the child property to protected, because protected is lower than public, and you're essentially decreasing the visibility and it's not going to work.

But if you set the parent property to protected, you could override it in the child class either with protected or public.

The same rules applies to methods, static properties and methods, and constants as well.

As you know, public properties are not ideal, because they break the principle of encapsulation.

So we'll set `$size` property to `protected` in the parent class and we override it in the child class with `public`

```php
<?php
	
namespace App;

class Toaster
{
	public array $slices = [];
	protected int $size = 2;
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public int $size = 4;
```

So now we can instantiate ToasterPro class and change the property in index.php

```php
$toaster = new ToasterPro();

$toaster->size = 10; // as $size is public we can change that value

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->toast();

```

One fix to avoid changing `$size` value is to set it to `private`, but we cannot override properties. Another fix is to use the `protected` access modifier, which is essentialy the same as private but it extends to the child classes. So let's show how to overwrite it.

### Constructor
Constructors are not required, so let's add a construct method to `Toaster` and ToasterPro classes :

```php
class Toaster
{
    protected array $slices;
    protected int $size;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->slices = [];
        $this->size = 2;
    }

```

```php
class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
	// we remove protected int $size since we're overwritting Toaster's extended $size property within the constructor
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->size = 4;
    }
```

`index.php`
```php
<?php

use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;
use App\Toaster;
use App\ToasterPro;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$toaster = new ToasterPro();

$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');
$toaster->addSlice('bread');

$toaster->toast();
```

But we get this error :
```
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Typed property App\Toaster::$slices must not be accessed before initialization in /var/www/app/Toaster.php:18 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/public/index.php(11): App\Toaster->addSlice('bread') #1 {main} thrown in /var/www/app/Toaster.php on line 18
```

The problem is that the method `addSlice()` is in the parent `Toaster` class, which is accessing the `$slices` property, but it's saying that this property is not initalized, even if we initialized it in the `Toaster`'s constructor. The reason this does not work is that when we override the constructor in the `ToasterPro` class, by default it's not going to call the parent's constructor method, but the child's one. So if we comment `ToasterPro` constructor, everything works :
```php

class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
//    public function __construct()
//    {
//        $this->size = 4;
//    }
```

In order to override the parent's method, we need to explicitly call the parent method using the `parent` keyword then double-colon (scope resolution operator) ant the call the method, `__construct` in this example.

```php
class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
        
        $this->size = 4;
    }
```

One thing to note is that **we need to be careful** when calling the parent construct method, because if we set `$this->size = 4` and call `parent::__construct();` after, the property will be set to 2:

```php
class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public function __construct()
    {   
        $this->size = 4;
		    
				parent::__construct();
    }
```

Antoher thing, if you don't have a constructor in the parent class, you cannot call the parent construct in the child. But we don't have to have a constructor in the parent class in order to have a constructor in the child class. We just cannot use the `parent` keyword, as there's no constructor in the parent.

All these rules applies to other methods as well. But you don't need to call the parent method, if you want to overwrite it and have custom logic in your child class you can do that. Just pay attention: when overwritting a method in PHP, the method signature of the child class must be compatible with the signature of the parent method, otherwise you get a Fatal error or, in versions prior to PHP 8, you get a warning. For  example in `addSlice()` we expect a `string $slice`:

```php
// Toaster (parent)
    public function addSlice(string $slice): void
    {
        if(count($this->slices) < $this->size) {
            $this->slices[] = $slice;
        }
    }

```

If we change it to `inst $slice` this will return a Fatal error.
```php
// ToasterPro
    public function addSlice(int $slice): void
    {
        // my custom logic
    }

```

The same applies to return types. if we return `void` in the parent method, we must return `void` in the child method, otherwise it will throw a fatal error.

**These compatibility rules applies to properties as well but do not apply to constructors.**

We could have some parameters in parent's constructor and another ones in child's constructor and this will not give an error :

```php
class Toaster
{
    protected array $slices;
    protected int $size;

    public function __construct(string $x)
    {
        $this->slices = [];
        $this->size = 2;
    }
```

```php
class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public function __construct(string $x, string $y, int $z)
    {
        parent::__construct($x);

        $this->size = 4;
    }

```


### The `final` keyword
> Final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance and method overriding

If you want to make sure that a specific class or a method cannot be extended from, you can use the `final` keyword. 

If you define a class as `final` this makes it not extendable :

```php

final class Toaster
{
    protected array $slices;
    protected int $size;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->slices = [];
        $this->size = 2;
    }
```

So if we try to extend this class, it will give us an error in the IDE `Class may not inherit from final class`: 
```php

class ToasterPro extends Toaster
{
    public function __construct(string $x)
    {
        parent::__construct();

        $this->size = 4;
    }
```

Similar, you could also have methods as `final`, so a method cannot be overrriden.

### Multi level inheritance

Instead of inheriting from one class you're inheriting from multiple classes through a hierarchy, so it's not multiple inheritance but its inheritance through hierarchy, which means that the dollas field inherits everything from the number field, the text filed and the base field.

![Capture d’écran du 2023-04-12 10-25-30.png](../_resources/Capture d’écran du 2023-04-12 10-25-30.png)

### Why inheritance might not be a good idea

- When overused or misused, inheritance could break the encapsulation principle, because it has access to the protected and private properties/methods/constants of the parent class.
- When you inherit from the parent class, you're actually inheriting ALL the public and protected methods that you might not even need in that child class.
- Inheritance creates tight coupling between parent & child classes

Use the "is a" relationship before deciding to use inheritance.

Ex.: ToasterPro "is a" Toaster

Do not use inheritance for every case, use it when you have the proper easy relationship between the child and the parent.

### Composition

Imagine a fancy oven that has also the toaster functionnality.

![Capture d’écran du 2023-04-12 10-39-54.png](../_resources/Capture d’écran du 2023-04-12 10-39-54.png)

Instead of inheriting Toaster, you could use Composition:

```php
class FacyOven
{
	// private ToasterPro $toaster;
	
	public function __construct(private ToasterPro $toaster) // use property promotion
	{
		// $this->toaster = $toaster
	}
	
	public function fry()
	{
		
	}
	
	public function toast()
	{
		$this->toaster->toast();
	}
	
	public function toastBagel()
	{
		$this->toaster->toastBagel();
	}
}
