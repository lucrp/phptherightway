An abstract class is like a template or the base class that the child or the concrete classes can extend from. This is done by inheritance.

Abstract rule's
- Can't instantiate abstract classes. You can only extend them.
- Can contain abstract methods in addition to regular methods & properties. The **abstract methods only contain the method's signature or the definition without the actually implementation**. An abstract class know the "what" but does not know the "how". The "how" part is implemented by the child classes, which give un another rule.
- Child classes **must** implement abstract methods.
- An abstract method only have the definition without the implementation.

## Example with Field class and its childs

base `Field.php` class
A base field can have some properties/methods that are shared with all fields. All the fields can have a name, so we define name as one of the properties. An we can have a method that render the field.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

abstract class Field 
	// with abstract keyword we no longer can instantiate base Field class
{
    public function __construct(protected string $name)
    {

    }
	
	abstract public function render(): string; 
	// just the signature without the implementation. 
	// It's means that all child classes that extends 
	// Field MUST implement the render() method.
}

```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Text extends Field
{
	// because we extend abstract class Field, we MUST implement render() abstract method OR make this class abstract.
    public function render(): string
    {
        return <<<HTML
<input type="text" name="{$this->name}" /> 
HTML; // in real apps we would use a view file to render, but in sake of simplicity we're using the heredoc sintax.
    }

}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

abstract class Boolean extends Field
{
	// as Boolean is a base class for Checkbox and Radio, we make it abstract as well and we implement the render() method in Checkbox and Radio classes
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Checkbox extends Boolean
{
    public function render(): string
    {
        return <<<HTML
<input type="checkbox" name="{$this->name}" /> 
HTML;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Radio extends Boolean
{
    public function render(): string
    {
        return <<<HTML
<input type="radio" name="{$this->name}" /> 
HTML;
    }
}
```


Because we're using Inheritance, all the child classes must follow the regular inheritance and signature compatibility rules, as discussed in the last lesson.

Methods that you're overwritting in the child class can actually have additional arguments with default values. And this applies to the implementation of abstract methods as well. For example, the abstract render() method do not accept any arguments, but if, in the implementation we add an argument **with a default value**, this is valid:
```php
class Text extends Field
{
    public function render($x = 1): string
    {
        return <<<HTML
<input type="text" name="{$this->name}" /> 
HTML; // in real apps we would use a view file to render, but in sake of simplicity we're using the heredoc sintax.
    }
```

Abstract methods visibility can only be public or protected, not private.

### When to use abstract classes and methods

- When you want to force the child classes to implement the methods while you provide some base functionality.
- If you have an abstract class where you have a lot of abstract methods, you should consider using Interfaces instead.
