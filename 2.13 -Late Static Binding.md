In PHP there are 2 types of bindings: 
- Early binding, which happens at compile time
- Late Binding, which happens at runtime

PHP get compiled on demand, even though it is abstracted away from us, it still there.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ClassA
{
    protected string $name = 'A';
    
    public function getName(): string
    {
    return $this->name;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ClassB extends ClassA
{
    protected string $name = 'B';
}
```
in `index.php`:
```php
$classA = new \App\LateBinding\ClassA(); // object that is an instance of ClassA
$classB = new \App\LateBinding\ClassB(); // object that is an instance of ClassB, which overwrites the $name property

echo $classA->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints A
echo $classB->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints B
//as ClassB extends ClassA, the $this variable called by ClassB refers to the calling object, so to the ClassB.
```
This is late binding, where the class is resolved at runtime, using the runtime information.

As the `$this` variable refers to the calling object, in the case of the second object (`$classB`), `$this` refers to the ClassB.

The method calls will depend on the type oh the object that we're calling that method on.
In the case of $classA we're calling `getName()` method on ClassA. And in the case of `$classB`, we're calling the method on 
`ClassB`, and because we're inheriting `ClassA` in `ClassB` it just calls that method on `ClassA` but the `$this` variable 
still refers to the calling object which is `ClassB`. So this class and method resolving and binding happens at runtime because 
it needs that additional runtime information to figure out on which class to call the method and on which class to access the certain 
properties and constants and so on.

This is basically what late binding is. To prove this :

```php
class ClassA
{
    protected string $name = 'A';

    public function getName(): string
    {
        var_dump(get_class($this));
        return $this->name;
    }
}
```

This will var_dump:
```php
string(22) "App\LateBinding\ClassA"
A
string(22) "App\LateBinding\ClassB"
B
```

Let's change the method and properties to static:

```php
<?php

namespace App\LateBinding;

class ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'A';

    public static function getName(): string
    {
        return self::$name;
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App\LateBinding;

class ClassB extends ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'B';
}
```
```php
//index.php
echo \App\LateBinding\ClassA::getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints 'A'
echo \App\LateBinding\ClassB::getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints 'A'
```
As we changed these method and properties to static, it prints `A A`, which is a problem, because we expected `A B`, like when we were using the `$this` variable.
But when we use the `self` keyword is printing `A A`. This is **early binding**: each time the line of code `retrun self::$name` runs it will 
reference the same class. It resolves the class at compile time. This is also the limitation of the `self` keyword. Unlike
`$this` variable, the `self` keyword does not follow the same inheritance rules and it resolves the class to which the method
belongs to or where it was defined.

We can `var_dump(self::class)` to see what the class is:
```php
    public static function getName(): string
    {
        var_dump(self::class);
        return self::$name;
    }
```
```php
string(22) "App\LateBinding\ClassA"
A
string(22) "App\LateBinding\ClassA"
A
```
This is the problem that **late static binding** solves.

One way to solve this is to overwrite the method in the child class and print `self::$name` there:
```php
class ClassB extends ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'B';

    public static function getName(): string
    {
        return self::getName();
    }
}
```
But this is not ideal because it goes against the purpose of INHERITANCE.

In older versions of PHP, before the proper solution was added, the `get_called_class()` function was used to figure out which is 
the calling class and then forward the static calls to that.

But in PHP 5.3, late static binding was introduced, where the class is resolved using late binding at runtinme instead of early binding
at compile time. It resolves class that was initially called at runtime.

Instead of introduce a new keyword, PHP maintainers decided to use an already existing reserved keyword for this: `static`.
That could be used with the scope resolution operator `::` to access static properties and constants and call static methods using late static binding.

So we can replace `self::$name` with `static::$name` and now we get `A B` as the expected output:

```php
class ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'A';

    public static function getName(): string
    {
        return static::$name;
    }
}
```

```php
echo \App\LateBinding\ClassA::getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints 'A'
echo \App\LateBinding\ClassB::getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints 'B'
```

Late static binding basically uses runtime information to determine how to call the method, or how to access the property or the constant.

And the way it works is that when the method is called, PHP stores the original class name of the last non-forwarding call
and then, when it encounters the `static` keyword, it resolves to the original class that it had stored before. 

The example of **non-forwarding call** is when you directly specify the class name like in the index.php example above `echo \App\LateBinding\ClassA::`. It's usually
before the scope resolution operator (`::`). However, when you use keyword like `parent` or `self` to access properties or
methods, those are called **forwarding calls** because it might forward the call to the parent class.

You can also use static keyword in a non-static context. The difference is that in the static context, the class name is explicitly 
specified on the left side of the scope resolution operator and that's the class name that gets stored by PHP and then used
at runtime when `static` keyword is found.

But in the context of Objects, when we're not within static calls, like
```php
echo $classA->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints A
echo $classB->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints B
```
it will resolve to the class of the calling object. 

So if we changed `getName()` back to non-static,

```php
class ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'A';

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return static::$name;
    }
}
```
and we instantiate and call the objects, it will print `A B` as expected :
```php
$classA = new \App\LateBinding\ClassA();
$classB = new \App\LateBinding\ClassB();

echo $classA->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints A
echo $classB->getName() . PHP_EOL; // prints B
```

In PHP8 you can also use the `static` keyword as a return type. You can already use `self` or `parent` as return types, but since PHP8 you can use `static`.

This can be useful when creating a new instance using the static keyword and returning that to implement something like a factory pattern.

Some quick example:
```php
class ClassA
{
    protected static string $name = 'A';

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return static::$name;
    }

    public static function make()
    {
        return new static();
    }
}
```

and in `index.php`:

```php
$classA = new \App\LateBinding\ClassA();
$classB = new \App\LateBinding\ClassB();

var_dump(\App\LateBinding\ClassA::make());
var_dump(\App\LateBinding\ClassB::make());
```

This will return:
```php
object(App\LateBinding\ClassA)#5 (0) {
}
object(App\LateBinding\ClassB)#5 (0) {
}
```

This would not work if we return explicitly a class or if we used `self` or `parent` keywords, like:
```php
    public static function make(): static
    {
        return new ClassA(); // or return new self;
    }
```

So what was added in PHP8 is that in the return type you were before able to specify self, but as we saw, self would always solve to the calling class.
And now, you can return `static` type instead.
