# Magic Methods 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCxnzj83poQ

Magic methods are special methods that override PHP's default behavior when certain event or action is performed on an object.

There are about 17 magic methods available and they begin with __

## __get() & __set()
Also known as magic getter and setter methods.

The magic `__get()` method gets called whenever you try to access a non-existing or inaccessible property on an object.

The magic `__set()` method gets called whenever you try to assign a value to an undefined or inaccessible property.

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/.../vendor/autoload.php';

$invoice = new App\Invoice();

$invoice->amount;
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    protected float $amount;

    public function __get(string $name)
    {
        var_dump($name);
    }

    public function __set(string $name, $value): void
    {
        var_dump($name, $value);
    }

}
```

One of the use-cases is to provide the read-only access to private and protected properties.

For example, you could do something like if property exists in the current object, return this property. Otherwise, return null.

This allows you to make a sort of error handling without triggering warnings and errors, cause the code will return the default null value if property does not exist. 


```php
    public function __get(string $name)
    {
        if (property_exists($this, $name)) {
            return $this->$name;
        }

        return null;
    }
```
This will give you a read-only access if setter method is not defined :

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    protected float $amount;

    public function __construct(float $amount)
    {
        $this->amount = $amount;
    }

    public function __get(string $name)
    {
        if (property_exists($this, $name)) {
            return $this->$name;
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```
`index.php`:
```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$invoice = new App\Invoice(15);

echo $invoice->amount . PHP_EOL;
```
If you want to make the property mutable, you could do the same with the __set magic method, and this would only mutate the availaible properties:

```php
    public function __set(string $name, $value): void
    {
        if (property_exists($this, $name)) {
            $this->$name = $value;
        }
    }

```

But this is not the best use case for these magic methods, because it breaks the encapsulation and when you use type hinting, specially with strict types enabled, when you try to set a property to a value that is not the same type as your defined property you would get an error;


Another use case is that instead of defining the properties and instead of having a bunch of properties, you could store them in an array:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    protected array $data;

    public function __get(string $name)
    {
        if (array_key_exists($name, $this->data)) {
            return $this->data[$name];
        }

        return null;
    }

    public function __set(string $name, $value): void
    {
        $this->data[$name] = $value;
    }

}
```

If you `var_dump($invoice)`, you'll see the data array contains the amount:

```php
$invoice = new App\Invoice(15);

$invoice->amount = 25;

var_dump($invoice);
```

```php
object(App\Invoice)#2 (1) {
  ["data":protected]=>
  array(1) {
    ["amount"]=>
    int(25)
  }
}

```

## __isset() & __unset()

`__isset()` gets called whe you use `isset` or `empty` functions on undefined or inaccessible properties.

`__unset()` gets called whe you use `unset` function on undefined or inaccessible properties

In Invoice class: 
```php
    public function __isset(string $name): bool
    {
        var_dump('isset');
        return array_key_exists($name, $this->data);
    }

    public function __unset(string $name): void
    {
        var_dump('unset');
        unset($this->data[$name]);
    }
```

`index.php`:
```php
$invoice = new App\Invoice();

$invoice->amount = 15;

var_dump(isset($invoice->amount));

unset($invoice->amount);

var_dump(isset($invoice->amount));

```

These 4 magic methods do not work with static properties, because they require Objects.
And these magic methods are not meant to replace standard getter and setter methods.
They're useful when you want to have special handling when undefined or inaccessible property is being accessed or is been set.

## __call() & __callStatic()

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
// This magic method uses 2 arguments, the first is the name of the method is being called and the second is the arguments that are being passed into that method call
    public function __call(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        var_dump($name, $arguments);
    }
}
```
`index.php`
```php
$invoice = new App\Invoice();

$invoice->process(1, 2, 3);
```
This will print the name and the arguments that were passed into that method:
```php
string(7) "process"
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
  [1]=>
  int(2)
  [2]=>
  int(3)
}
```

This magic method does not get triggered whenever a static method call is made:
```php
App\Invoice::process(1, 2, 3);

// returns an error:
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method App\Invoice::process() in /var/www/public/index.php:11
Stack trace:
#0 {main}
  thrown in /var/www/public/index.php on line 11
```
For this case, you have another magic method called `__callStatic()`:

```php
    public static function __callStatic(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        var_dump('static', $name, $arguments);
    }
```
This will print the static method called in index.php

```php
string(6) "static"
string(7) "process"
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
  [1]=>
  int(2)
  [2]=>
  int(3)
}
```
This is actually very powerful, and we see it being used in popular framework as Laravel and Symfony.
For example, you could use these methods to defer the calls to another object or even within this object.

If we had a `process()` method available here and called it in index, this will print the process method as it is available publicly:
```php
class Invoice
{
    public function process()
    {
        var_dump('process');
    }
```

But if we change the process() method to private or protected, the magic method is called.
You could use this magic method to simply do like, if method exists on the current object then call the method:

```php
class Invoice
{
    protected function process()
    {
        var_dump('process');
    }

    public function __call(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            $this->$name();
        }
    }

```
But there's a problem with this, because what if this process method accepted some arguments like amount and description, 
how do we pass these arguments to this method call:
```php
class Invoice
{
    protected function process(float $amount, $description)
    {
        var_dump('process');
    }

    public function __call(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            $this->$name($arguments);
        }
    }
}
```

index.php
```php
$invoice = new App\Invoice();

$invoice->process(15, 'Some description');
```
This will result in error because the argument that is being passed into the process method is an array,
because its passing hte entire arguments array as the first argument, so instead of the float we're getting an array:

```php
    public function __call(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            $this->$name($arguments);
        }
    }
```
To solve this problem you could use a function called `call_user_func_array()` which accepts a callable or you could simply
pass in an array where the first element is the object where you want to call the method on, and in this case, that is `$this`, and the second 
element is the name of the method which is `$name` and then the second argument you pass is the `$arguments`:
```php
    public function __call(string $name, array $arguments)
    {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            call_user_func_array([$this, $name], $arguments);
        }
    }
```
And now no more errors, it is calling process method with the correct arguments. If we `var_dump($amount, $description)` is working as expected:
```php
float(15)
string(16) "Some description"
```

The same would apply to `__callStatic()`. You would check if the method exists on some sort of object and you would defer that call.

This makes both of these magic methods very powerful that allows you to sprinkle a bit of magic to your code base.

You're able to defer the method calls to other objects which do not have to be the current object.

In this exemple we used the current object to call the protected method, but you could essentially resolve another object maybe from a container
and call the method on that object instead.

You could even call non-static method statically by resolving the object within the callStatic magic method and then defer the call to that object.
This is exactly how Laravel framework fa√ßades work behind the scenes.

## __toString()
This magic method gets called whenever you try to interact with the object as string.

Maybe you try to echo it out or cast it into a string.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    protected function process(float $amount, $description)
    {
        var_dump($amount, $description);
    }

    public function __toString(): string
    {
        return 'Hello';
    }
}
```
In index we `echo` `$invoice` and we get 'Hello'.

If we comment out `__toString` magic method, we get an error that the object cannot be converted to a string.

This magic method is practical and flexible because now you can have objects that can be interacted with as strings.
It could return something like "This invoice with amount 55 was processed on this date ...".

Note that if you try to return something other than a string (like an integer), this will work only if you're not in strict mode.

Another thing to note is that since PHP8, classes that define the magic `__toString()` method will implicitly implement the 
Stringable interface, a built-in interface offered by PHP8> :
```php
var_dump($invoice instanceof Stringable);
// returns true
```
Prior to PHP8, you would have to explicitly implement the Stringable interface
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice implements \Stringable
{
```
This is good to force the class to declare the __toString method but is no longer required (BUT STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED).

## __invoke()

This method gets triggered when you try to call the object directly.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        var_dump('invoked');
    }
}
```

index.php:
```php
$invoice();
```
It prints `invoked`. If we comment out the __invoke magic method, we get a fatal error saying this object is not callable :
`Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Object of type App\Invoice is not callable in /var/www/public/index.php:11`

If we comment out `__invoke()` and `var_dump(is_callable($invoice));`, it will return `false`. When we define __invoke, it returns `true`.

This magic method is useful to implement Single Action Classes. Its useful when you want to have single responsibility classes, where classes are responsible for only a single thing. 

For example if this class was called ProcessInvoice, it's indicating that the class is supposed to process only Invoices.
Putting other logic in this class would not make sense and would break the Single Responsibility Principle and therefore we don't need
a bunch of methods in it. We only need a single method. So, instead of defining that single method, we could just make it invokable
and invoke that call by simply calling the object directly.

## __debugInfo()

Its used to specify which properties can be printed when called with var_dump().

For example, let's say we have a class with some properties and between these properties we have sensitive data, like account number:

```php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    private float $amount;
    private int $id = 1;
    private string $accountNumber = '0123456789';

    public function __debugInfo(): ?array
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'accountNumber' => '****' . substr($this->accountNumber, -4),

        ];
    }

}
```

```php
$invoice = new App\Invoice();
var_dump($invoice);
```

this will print :

```php
object(App\Invoice)#2 (2) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["accountNumber"]=>
  string(8) "****6789"
}
```
