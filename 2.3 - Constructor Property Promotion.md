    // There's no sense to have $amount public available cause that can cause bugs where amount is explicitly changed outside of the class. We should not let anything other than the Transaction class itself change the amount property. Instead, we create a getter function to access the amount of the object created by this class.

    // Here, addTax and applyDiscount don't return anything currently. We could simply just return $this variable, which refers to the calling object, which is the instance of the Transaction class. So we can specify Transaction as the return type. We could also use the self keyword, but we'll get into that later when we'll see about inheritance and statics. We'll use the class name for now.
