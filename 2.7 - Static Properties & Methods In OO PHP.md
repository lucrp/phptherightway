# Use cases of static properties
 - Counter
 - Cache values with **memoization** to speed up expensive operations by caching the results for later access
 - Implementation of Singleton Pattern: maintains a single instance of a given class throughout your app execution
 - Create some kind of utility method that don't really need instance of the class (like a Formatter class for currency, amount etc. )
 - Factory Pattern: responsible for creating objects of other classes
 	- `$transaction = TransactionFactory::make(25, 'Transaction 1');`  but the better way is to use **Dependency Injection**
  - Use of static closures or callbacks to avoid unexpected behavior and bugs.
 
 The use of static methods and properties is discouraged because they represent what's called a global state, which means that you can modify the data or call the static function from anywhere in the code which can make things harder to maintain and debug.

### Example
`Paddle/Transaction.php`
```php
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);

namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
    private static int $count = 0;


    public function __construct(
        public float $amount,
        public string $description
    )
    {
        self::$count++;
    }

    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processing paddle transaction...';
    }

    /**
     * @return int
     */
    public static function getCount(): int
    {
        return self::$count;
    }

}
```

- You don't need to instantiate a class to access the static properties and methods of the class, because they belong to the class itself and not to any particular object or instance

- You can think of static properties as global variables in a way. Their values are shared across the objects because they are not tied to a particular object or instance. They're tied to the class itself.
