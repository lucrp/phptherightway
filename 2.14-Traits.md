# Traits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMruqUC4Qpc

PHP is a single inheritance language and does not support multiple inheritance, meaning that you can only extend a single class.

But there are ways you can achieve something similar to multiple inheritance in PHP: using Traits or Interfaces.

Before, let's see what the problem is with multiple inheritance and why we would care to have an alternative to 
multiple inheritance in PHP.

## Problem
Imagine you have a CoffeeMaker class that makes coffee. You also have a LatteMaker class that makes coffee AND Latte. 
And a CapuccinoMaker class that makes coffee AND capuccino:

![single_inheritance](imgs/single_inheritance.png)

In this case we can benefit from the power of Inheritance and extend the CoffeeMaker from the Latte and Capuccino maker classes
and just add additional methods (makeCapuccino and makeLatte): this is **single inheritance**.

Let's say you also have an All in One Coffee Maker that makes coffee, latte and cappuccino. In some other languages you could 
use multiple inheritance and extend both LatteMaker and CappuccinoMaker classes. But in PHP this is not allowed

![all_in_one_coffee_maker](imgs/all_in_one_coffee_maker.png)

However PHP supports Traits, that lets you share common functionality from multiple classes.

## Testing coffee makers
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CoffeeMaker
{
    public function makeCoffee()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making coffee' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
```php
// index.php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$coffeeMaker = new \App\CoffeeMaker();
$coffeeMaker->makeCoffee();

$latteMaker = new App\LatteMaker();
$latteMaker->makeCoffee();
$latteMaker->makeLatte();

$cappuccinoMaker = new App\CappuccinoMaker();
$cappuccinoMaker->makeCoffee();
$cappuccinoMaker->makeCappuccino();

//$allInOneCoffeeMaker = new App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker();
//$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeCoffee();
//$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeLatte();
//$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeCappuccino();

```
With the 3 first classes, this will return:
```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
```
But how do we get the AllInOneCoffeeMaker to make all kind of coffee ?

One way of doing this is to use Interfaces. We could extract makeLatte into an interface, then implement that interface 
in the LatteMaker class and define the concrete implementation in the LatteMaker class. We could do the same for
AllInOneCoffeeMaker and extends the regular CoffeeMaker to be able to make regular coffee as well.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker implements MakesLatte
{
    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker implements MakesCapuccino
{
    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends MakeCoffee implements MakesLatte, MakesCappuccino
{
    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte' . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

The problem with this approach is that we would have to copy makeLatte and makeCappuccino methods in the AllInOneCoffeMaker,
making the method body exactly the same across all classes. So we are duplicating the code.

However, if the concrete implementations in AllInOneCoffeeMaker were different, like if it was doing cappuccino and latte in some
different way where you would have slightly different body or implementation of that method, then Interfaces is the right way 
of doing so, because you're coding to interface and you're providing the concrete implementation for each of those methods.

Interfaces are good and the ideal solution when the actual implementation is different.

But if you're just duplicating the code there is a better way.

## Traits

> Traits are mainly used to reduce code duplications and increase code reuse

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use LatteTrait;
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait LatteTrait
{
    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait;
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait CappuccinoTrait
{
    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

### How to use Traits
If we run the code now with the traits, we can see that is working as expected:
```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
```
And if we apply traits to AllInOneCoffeMaker, you can pull multiple traits by comma separating them or, if you're following
PSR12, you need to put them on its own line:
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use LatteTrait;
    use CappuccinoTrait;
}
```

And if we run the code, everything is working:
```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making latte
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```
>Think of Traits as COPY/PASTE: it simply takes the code that's written in the trait and pastes it in the classes that
uses the trait in compile time.

### Rules

Trait offers many features and there are some rules to follow.

First important thing to note is that you cannot instantiate objects of traits. 
Instead, you need to use the traits within other traits or within classes.

Other important rules:

#### Method precedence & method overriding
You're allowed to redefine the trait's method. If the class that uses the
trait defines the same method, then when that method is called, the method defined directly on the class takes precedence
over the method from the trait.

For example, in `CappuccinoMaker` class, if we override `makeCappuccino()` method (the same used in `CappuccinoTrait`, called in `CappuccinoMaker` class), 
the redefined class method takes precedence over the trait's method:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait;

    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo 'Making cappuccino (UPDATED)' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
Making cappuccino (UPDATED)
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making latte
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```

However, if the method was defined in the base class but is not overriden in the child class that uses the trait with the same
method definition, then the method from the trait will override the method defined in the base class.
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait;
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait CappuccinoTrait
{
    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function makeCoffee() // This method has HIGHER PRECEDENCE over the base class
    {
        echo 'Making coffee (UPDATED)' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
Making coffee (UPDATED)
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
Making coffee (UPDATED)
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making latte
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```

The precedence's order:

1. The class method that is defined directly on the class
2. The trait method that's defined in the trait
3. The base method defined in the parent class, if there is any.

#### Conflict resolution (`insteadof` and `as` operators)

The similar conflict resolution problem that exists in multiple inheritance in other languages also
exists with the traits: that happens when 2 method are conflicting because of the same name. 

Suppose that CappuccinoTrait also have a method called `makeLatte()`:
```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait CappuccinoTrait
{
    public function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . 'Making latte (from CappuccinoTrait)' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
If we run the code we get a fatal error because `AllInOneCoffeeMaker` uses LatteTrait and CappuccinoTrait, and both traits have 
a `makeLatte()` method:
```
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino

Fatal error: Trait method App\CappuccinoTrait::makeLatte has not been applied as App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker::makeLatte, because of collision with App\LatteTrait::makeLatte in /var/www/app/AllInOneCoffeeMaker.php on line 5
```
This problem can be easily solved using `insteadof` operator letting you choose which method to call:
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        LatteTrait::makeLatte insteadof CappuccinoTrait;
    }
    use LatteTrait:
}
```
If we want to use `makeLatte()` from CappuccinoTrait we can also do this with `insteadof` operator:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        CappuccinoTrait::makeLatte insteadof LatteTrait;
    }
    use LatteTrait;
}
```
And now we can see that `makeLatte()` is being called from `CappuccinoTrait`:
```
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\AllInOneCoffeeMakerMaking latte (from CappuccinoTrait)
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```

Another way to solve this problem is to use alias with `as` operator:

```php
class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        CappuccinoTrait::makeLatte insteadof LatteTrait;
    }
    use LatteTrait {
        LatteTrait::makeLatte as makeOriginalLatte;
    }
}
```
and in `index.php`:
```php
$allInOneCoffeeMaker = new App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker();
$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeCoffee();
$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeLatte();
$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeOriginalLatte();
$allInOneCoffeeMaker->makeCappuccino();
```

and we can see that AllInOneCoffeeMaker is makin latte from the regular method and also from the LatteTrait:
```
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making latte
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\AllInOneCoffeeMakerMaking latte (from CappuccinoTrait)
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making latte
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```

#### Visibility
You can also change the visibility of the methods with `as` operator. If we change the visibility of `makeCappuccino()` method
declared in `CappuccinoTrait` to private 

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait CappuccinoTrait
{
    private function makeCappuccino() // we use private keyword
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
we can access it creating a method in the class that uses this trait, like:

```php
class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait;
    use LatteTrait;
    
    public function foo()
    {
        $this->makeCappuccino();
    }
}
```

But to access this private method outside another method (as we did above) we have to change its visibility when using the trait with a `as` operator (just like we did with `insteadof` operator):


```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    // declare the trait's method as public to use them without errors
    use CappuccinoTrait {
     CappuccinoTrait::makeCappuccino as public;
    }
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        CappuccinoTrait::makeCappuccino as public;
    }
    use LatteTrait;
}
```

This is not a good solution though.

#### Composing traits from other traits

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait CappuccinoTrait
{
    use LatteTrait;

    private function makeCappuccino()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making cappuccino' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
#### Properties with traits

In addition to being able to define methods in the traits, you could also define properties and access them in the classes.
For example, let's say we want to specify what type of milk we're using for latte:
```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait LatteTrait
{
    protected string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
But because we defined the property in the trait, the rule is that the underlying class cannot define the same property
with the same name, UNLESS it is fully compatible, i.e. the visibility, the type AND the initial or default value HAS to be the same.

#### Abstract methods in traits

Something you might see in frameworks is that they make use of `$this` variable without defining the property in the trait:
```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait LatteTrait
{
    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
In the code above, `$this` refers to a magical property that does not exist on the trait, so it assumes that `milkType` property
exists on the underlying class that uses this trait :

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use LatteTrait;

    private string $milkTye = 'whole-milk';
}
```
```php
<?php

namespace App;

class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        CappuccinoTrait::makeCappuccino as public;
    }
    use LatteTrait;

    private string $milkTye = 'whole-milk';
}
```

If we run the code it works properly, but it's not ideal to reference magical properties like that because we're 
assuming that the underlying classes that uses this trait defines that property.

Instead, another solution is to enforce an underlying class to define a method that gives you the value for that property:
So instead of `$this->milk` you could do `$this->getMilkType()` :
```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    protected string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->getMilkType() . PHP_EOL;
    }
    
    public function getMilkType(): string
    {
        return 'whole-milk';
    }
}
```
But this is not the proper solution, because we're hard coding the 'whole-milk', even if this works, but it's taking the value
of the hardcoded milk type and not from the property. To solve this, certain developers use `property_exists` function:

```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    protected string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->getMilkType() . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function getMilkType(): string
    {
        if (property_exists($this, 'milkType')) {
            return $this->milkType;
        }
        
        return '';
    }
}
```

But again this is not the ideal solution, because you're forced to do this `property_exists` validation
and you might also want to do `method_exist` validation if you're referencing to a method that you're assuming it would exist
on the underlying class.

There's another way to solve this, although Gio is not a big fan of this approach, is that with traits you can define
abstract methods within traits. So instead of providing the concrete definition as above, we could simply 

```php
    abstract public function getMilkType(): string;
```
and now we're making sure that any class that uses this trait has to provide the concrete implementation of this method.

In inheritance, if you have at least one abstract method, the entire class has to be marked as abstract, but this rule does not
apply to traits. When you have an abstract method in the trait you don't have to mark the class that uses that trait as abstract.

So in `LatteMaker` class, we have just to add the concrete implementation of the trait's abstract method:

```php
class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use LatteTrait;

    private string $milkTye = 'whole-milk';

    public function getMilkType(): string
    {
        return $this->milkType;
    }
}
```

we do the same in AllInOneCoffeeMaker class (and we remove use `LatteTrait` from MakeCappuccino just for this example):

```php
class AllInOneCoffeeMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use CappuccinoTrait {
        CappuccinoTrait::makeCappuccino as public;
    }
    use LatteTrait;

    private string $milkTye = 'whole-milk';

    public function getMilkType(): string
    {
        return $this->milkType;
    }
}
```

And now everything works. But Gio thinks this is not the best approach. To him, the better way of solving this is to declare
the property with the default value in the trait, and if we want to change this value, we make a set method in the trait:

```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    protected string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function setMilkType(string $milkType): static
    {
        $this->milkType = $milkType;

        return $this;
    }
}
```
And if we want to change the value of milkType we call this method in the class that uses this trait. This is much cleaner
than having abstract method and duplicate the code across different classes.

>Prior to PHP8, you were only able to define public or protected abstract methods within the traits. But since PHP8 you can also 
define private abstract methods which is not possible with abstract classes when you're defining abstract methods.

#### Static properties & methods in Traits

In addition to have regular properties and methods, you could also have static properties and static methods:
```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    private string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public static int $x = 3;

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public static function foo()
    {
        echo 'Foo Bar' . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function setMilkType(string $milkType): static
    {
        $this->milkType = $milkType;

        return $this;
    }
}
```
If we call these static method and property in index.php:
```php
\App\LatteMaker::foo();
echo \App\LatteMaker::$x;
```
we can see that `Foo Bar` and `3` are printed.

>But when a trait has a static property, be aware that **each classes that uses that trait will have the independent instance
of that property**, unlike inheritance where static property is shared.

To see this in action, let's test first with inheritance. 

We have the `CoffeeMaker` base class where we add a 
`public static string` property called `$foo`:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CoffeeMaker
{
    public static string $foo;
    
    public function makeCoffee()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making coffee' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

And we have the `LatteMaker` class (that extends `CoffeMaker`).

So in `index.php` we call both `CoffeeMaker` and `LatteMaker` `$foo` property but whit different values to test:
```php
\App\CoffeeMaker::$foo = 'foo';
\App\LatteMaker::$foo = 'bar';

echo \App\CoffeeMaker::$foo . ' ' . \App\LatteMaker::$foo . PHP_EOL;
```
This will print `bar bar` to both. 

So as you see, **when using inheritance the static property is SHARED, so when we change the values, it
affects the original class as well.** This does not happen with TRAITS.

Now, let's test this with trait. In `LatteTrait`:

```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    private string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public static string $foo; // we declare the static property in the trait

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function setMilkType(string $milkType): static
    {
        $this->milkType = $milkType;

        return $this;
    }
}
```

And in `index.php`, we know that the property `$foo` is available on the `LatteMaker` because `LatteMaker` class use `LatteTrait`. 
We also know that AllInOneCoffeeMaker also uses the LatteTrait as well and therefore it also has the property `$foo`:

```php
\App\LatteMaker::$foo = 'foo';
\App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker::$foo = 'bar';

echo \App\LatteMaker::$foo . ' ' . \App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker::$foo . PHP_EOL;
```

>Now it prints `foo bar`. So as we can see, the static properties in this case are not shared and **each individual class that
uses the trait has its own version of the static property.**

#### Magic `__CLASS__` constant in traits
The magic `__CLASS__` constant when used in a trait will resolve to the class where the trait is used:

For example in LatteTrait we can use `__CLASS__` to echo the name of the class that use this trait:
```php
trait LatteTrait
{
    private string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public static string $foo;

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo __CLASS__ . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function setMilkType(string $milkType): static
    {
        $this->milkType = $milkType;

        return $this;
    }
}
```
### Gio's opinion on Traits
Gio thinks that traits are great when properly used and not overused.

>**Traits should not be used for anything other than simple code reuse**. When you're defining a method as abstract in a trait
> you're trying to enforce a contract. **If you want to enforce contracts, you should use** either abstract classes with abstract 
> methods or, better, **interfaces**.

Let's see an example where we can't exactly enforce things with traits because certain rules don't apply like it applies with 
inheritance. For example, the `final` keyword.

When we're using inheritance, we can define, in the base class, a method as `final` to be sure that this method will not be
overwritten in child classes.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class CoffeeMaker
{
    final public function makeCoffee()
    {
        echo static::class . ' is making coffee' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```

And now if we try to overwrite this method in a child class that extends `CoffeMaker`, we get this fatal error:

`Fatal error: Cannot override final method App\CoffeeMaker::makeCoffee() in /var/www/app/LatteMaker.php on line 9`

But this same restriction does not apply when the final method is declared within a trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait LatteTrait
{
    private string $milkType = 'whole-milk';

    public static string $foo;

    final public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo __CLASS__ . ' is making latte with ' . $this->milkType . PHP_EOL;
    }

    public function setMilkType(string $milkType): static
    {
        $this->milkType = $milkType;

        return $this;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class LatteMaker extends CoffeeMaker
{
    use LatteTrait;

    public function makeLatte()
    {
        echo 'MAKING LATTE' . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
```
And if we run this code we get :

```bash
App\CoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\LatteMaker is making coffee
MAKING LATTE
App\CappuccinoMaker is making coffee
App\CappuccinoMaker is making cappuccino
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making coffee
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making latte with whole-milk
App\AllInOneCoffeeMaker is making cappuccino
```

And now it's printing `MAKING LATTE` instead of `App\LatteMaker is making latte with whole-milk`.

Another thing Gio does not like is that you should not be able to change the method visibility, because it makes maintenance
and testing complicated.

>Why would you define a method as protected or private only to change its visibility to public? That should not event be allowed
> in my opinion and should result in a fatal error.

## Traits vs. Inheritance example 

In the CoffeMaker examples we're using single inheritance and all these classes are somewhat related to each other, because
they're all coffee makers.

Traits also allow non-related or independent classes share common functionality:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Customer
{
    public function updateProfile()
    {
        echo 'Profile Updated' . PHP_EOL;

        // send email
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processed Invoice' . PHP_EOL;

        // send email
    }

}
```

Customer and Invoice are not related to each other, but both classes have methods that need to send an email, and sending email could be the same 
for both of these methods. One way to add the send email functionality would be to add send email code to both of these methods, but this would introduce
code duplication.

Another solution would be to add a method to the Customer class, like `sendEmail()` and then extend Customer in the Invoice.
But this also does not make sense, because Invoice is not a Customer. This would be a wrong way of using inheritance,
because it does not pass the "is a" relationship.

Another solution would be to create a Mail class with a sendEmail method and extend Mail class to both Customer and Invoice classes.
But this is also the wrong use of inheritance, for the same reason: it does not pass the "is a" relationship.
Customer is not a mail and Invoice is not a mail either.

Instead we need a way to share common functionality between such independent classes: this is where traits can help.

Instead of Mail class we can do a Mail trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

trait Mail
{
    public function sendEmail()
    {
        // send email code here
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class Invoice
{
    use Mail;
    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processed Invoice' . PHP_EOL;

        // send email
        $this->sendEmail();
    }
}
```
This way we can use the trait in both Customer and Invoice classes and avoid code duplication AND the misuse of inheritance.
