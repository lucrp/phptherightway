# Encapsulation
Encapsulation bundles the data and methods that operates on that data in one unit, like a class for example. It hides the internal representation or the state of the object which protects the integrity of that object.

Encapsulation ensures that your object manages its own state and nothing can change that unless it explicitly allowed.

In PHP we have 3 visibility access modifiers:
- `public` means it can be accessed outside of this class by anyone interacting with the object.
- `private` means that the property/method can only be accesses from within the class itself
- `protected` is pretty much the same as private but it extends to the child or subclasses. Cover in Inheritance

Setting `$amount` to public can break encapsulation principle because anyone interacting with this object can modifiy the state of it, causing bugs:

`Transaction.php`
```php
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);

namespace App\PaymentGateway\Paddle;

class Transaction
{
// 		public float $amount;
		private float $amount;

    public function __construct(float $amount)
    {
        $this->amount = $amount;
    }

    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processing $' . $this->amount . ' paddle transaction...';
    }
}
```

`index.php`
```php
<?php

use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25);

// Because we set $amount as public we canc change the state 
// of our object changing the value of the $amount, 
// which is a problem and affect how the process method is handled 
$transaction->amount = 125;

$transaction->process();

```

We can fix that setting the property to `private` to ensure that interaction outside of this class will be restricted. So in this case to access a private property we have to create a public method to get the value of this property (a GETTER):

```php
public function getAmount(): float
{
	return $this->amount;
}
```

And to change the $amount property, we'll create a set public method (a SETTER):
```php
public function setAmount(): float
{
	$this->amount = $amount;
}
```

But with the setAmount being public we can also change the state of this property in `index.php`. 

- Getters & setters don't always break the encapsulation 

So if you want to ensure that this property value does not change, remove the setter, use only the getter, and make sure you don't have another method that changes the state of that object. You have to accept the value through the constructor or through the method that we call instead of the setter. And for whatever reason if we want to change the amount then we should simply create a new transaction object instead of changing the state of the object already created.

One use case for public properties (used in popular frameworks) is for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

>**Do not define getter and setter methods for every single property, unless and until you actually need them!**

In addition to protecting properties you might also have some methods that are not meant to be exposed or publicly available (they might be internal implementation). So you want to hide those as well.

Ex:
```php
    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processing $' . $this->amount . ' paddle transaction...';
		
				$this->generateReceipt();
		
				$this->sendEmail();
    }
```

We can not set these methods (`generateReceipt()` and `sendEmail()`) to public, because it can cause some issues, because they can be called without ever calling process() outside of this class.

We can actually break encapsulation and access private and protected properties/methods using the PHP's builtin Reflection API

# Abstraction

Abstraction principle simply means that internal implementations details of an object are hidden from the user.

You could call a method on the object, maybe provide some input and get output, but you don't care how the method is implemented an how it works behind the scenes. You just care about is that you call it and expect some kind of output or some kind of result.

For example, for the process() method, we don't care which payment gateway this process connects to, we don't care how it's saved in the DB, we don't care wheter it sends an email or not and we don't care how it generates the receipt. All we care about is that it process the transaction.

This is abstraction in simple terms. You're basically hiding the implementation details from the user

You could change the way transaction is processed. Maybe you could change the payment gateway or maybe you now decide that you don't want to send an email or change the way the receipt is generated and so on.

The point is that the place where you call the process method does not and should not care what goes on within that process method and any changes to that process method should not affect this part of the code 
```php
<?php

use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25);

$transaction->process();

```


>**Encapsulation hides the internal state or the infformation while Abstraction hides the actually implementation of it.**

# Bonus

Objects of the same type can access each other's private and protected properties and methods:

```php
class Transaction
{
    private float $amount;

    public function __construct(float $amount)
    {
        $this->amount = $amount;
    }

    public function copyFrom(Transaction $transaction)
    {
        var_dump($transaction->amount, $transaction->sendEmail());
    }

    public function process()
    {
        echo 'Processing $' . $this->amount . ' paddle transaction...';
    }

    private function sendEmail(): bool
    {
        // send email
        return true;
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

use App\PaymentGateway\Paddle\Transaction;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$transaction = new Transaction(25);

$transaction->copyFrom(new Transaction(100));
// print float(100) bool(true)
```
